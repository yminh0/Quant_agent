    The claim rule is `owner_incarnation != mine`. Under one worker that means "a dead

    mid-analysis, and this sweep would fail work in flight - the client sees a run that
    was progressing turn into `interrupted_by_restart` for no reason it can observe.

    There is no lease behind the rule: no heartbeat, no expiry, nothing the owner
    refreshes while it works. So the reaper has no way to tell a dead owner from a busy
    one, and the safety comes entirely from the startup guard below rather than from the
    claim itself.

    This asserts the unsafe behaviour on purpose. It is not a description of what should
    happen under two workers - it is the tripwire that makes anyone lifting the worker
    limit come here and build the lease first.
