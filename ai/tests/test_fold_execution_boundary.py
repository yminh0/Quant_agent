"""What a walk-forward fold hands the engine, and what the report says about it.

Every fold starts the engine in cash on its own evaluation month, but the action
generator used to be built on that fold's context window alone. Two things followed:

  * it entered the month believing it still held whatever it had bought during
    train/validation, so it issued no entry - measured on the deployed five-year rule,
    506 of 896 evaluation sessions (56.5%) were spent 100% in cash;
  * ``date_number`` restarted at the fold's first bar, so the 21-day rotation grid
    landed on different absolute dates in every fold, and long-window derived metrics
    (sma200, 12-1 momentum) never warmed up inside a one-year window.

Actions are now built on the whole-window store, with the fold's first tradable session
marked as the point where the book restarts from cash. These tests pin that, the slot
release that follows a stop, and the reporting definitions that go out with it.
