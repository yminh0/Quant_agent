"""Compile structured strategy conditions into build_signals decision expressions.

The screen (SQL) and the backtest (build_signals) used to encode a strategy's rule
separately, so "the stocks recommended today" and "the rule the backtest actually
traded" could differ. The screen now emits the rule as structured Conditions; this
module turns those same Conditions into the boolean expressions build_signals evaluates
per stock per date, so both run one definition.

Only price-series conditions compile: build_signals is handed daily price rows
(open/high/low/close/volume and rsi), and nothing else. Financial conditions
(4 quarters of rising operating income) and cross-sectional ones (top 20% by revenue
growth) reference data the backtest does not carry, so they return None and the caller
keeps its template profiles. window/aggregate attach to whichever side is a series -
the metric side - so "close >= 252-day max of high" and "20-day average close >= 1000"
both read naturally.
